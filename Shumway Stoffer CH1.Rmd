Plotting and importing the library of the book. 

1) J&J historical quarterly earnings, obvious heteroskedasticity and non stationarity.

```{r}
library(astsa)
plot(jj, type='o', ylab='Quarterly EPS')
```
2) Dow Jones index daily log returns. It is mean reverting with the time series being differenced once, but it is heteroskedastic with varying magnitudes of fluctations.

```{r}
library(xts)
djia_ret=diff(log(djia$Close))[-1]
plot(djia_ret, main='Dow Jones Returns', type='n')
lines(djia_ret)

```
3) Plotting two time series aligned on separate graphs:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,1)) # setting up the grid
plot(soi, ylab='', xlab='', main='Southern Oscillation Index')
plot(rec, ylab='', xlab='', main='Recruitment')
```

4) Plotting multiple vectors of time series originating from the same sources.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
ts.plot(fmri1[,2:5], col=1:4, ylab='BOLD', main='Cortex')
ts.plot(fmri1[,6:9], col=1:4, ylab='BOLD', main='Thalamus and Cerebellum')

```

Plotting standard normal White Noise and its moving average with 3 times. The series looks smoother after
taking moving average.

```{r}
w = rnorm(1000,0,1)
v = filter(w, sides = 2, filter = rep(1/3,3)) # moving average
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot.ts(w, main = 'N(0,1) distributed white noise (n=1000)')
plot.ts(v, ylim=c(-3,3), main="moving average")
```

Simulating an AR(2) with the above white noise where $x_t=x_{t-1}-0.9x_{t-2}+w_t$:

Notice that it is stationary as the roots of the characteristic polynomial $1-0.9x+x^2=0$ lie outside the unit circle.

```{r}
x = filter(w, filter=c(1, -0.9), method='recursive')[-(1:50)] # first 50 removed
plot.ts(x, main='AR(2)')
```
Random walk with drift: $x_t=a+x_{t-1}+w_t$ where $a\in\mathbb{R}$ is the drift term.

```{r}
x = cumsum(w[0:200])
wd = w + 0.2
xd = cumsum(wd[0:200])
plot.ts(xd, ylim=c(-5,55), main='random walk', ylab='')
lines(x, col=4)
abline(h=0, col=4, lty=2)
abline(a=0, b=0.2, lty=2)

```

Harmonic model: $x_t=2\cos(2\pi\frac{t+15}{50})+w_t$. When signal to noise ratio, $\sigma_w=1$, we have $w_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. When $\sigma_w=5$, we have $w_t\sim\mathcal{N}(0,5^2)$. See the differences between the signal to noise ratios:

```{r}
cs = cos(2*pi*(1:500/50+-.6*pi))
w = rnorm(500, 0, 1)
par(mfrow=c(3,1), mar=c(3,2,2,1), cex.main=1.5)
plot.ts(cs, main=expression(2*cos(2*pi*t/50+.6*pi)))
plot.ts(cs+w, main=expression(2*cos(2*pi*t/50+.6*pi) + N(0,1)))
plot.ts(cs+5*w, main=expression(2*cos(2*pi*t/50+.6*pi) + N(0,25)))
```

The autocovariance function of Gaussian white noise $\epsilon_t$ is: $\gamma_\epsilon(s,t)=\begin{case}\sigma^2 & ,s=t\\0 & \text{else} \end{case}$.

Now looking at the cross correlation function:
Observe that y leads x before lag -5, the CCF peaks at lag=-5 and then x starts to lead y at higher lags.
```{r}
x = rnorm(1000)
y = lag(x, -5) + rnorm(1000)
ccf(x, y, ylab='CCF', main='', type='covariance')
```
